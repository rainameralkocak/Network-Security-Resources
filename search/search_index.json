For example, AI-based malware can bypass defense systems by analyzing the behavior of the target.</p>"},{"location":"Emerging-threads/#countermeasures","title":"Countermeasures:","text":"<p>AI-based security solutions should be developed to monitor network traffic and detect abnormal activities. For instance, according to Symantec's report, machine learning-based security solutions can detect cyber attacks with an 85% success rate [1]. Human-supervised AI systems can be used to reduce false positives and false negatives. A study by IBM Security found that a combination of human and machine collaboration is more effective in AI-based security solutions [2]. It is important to simulate cyber attacks using AI methods to test defense systems. This can provide security teams with real-world experience and help identify security vulnerabilities.</p>"},{"location":"Emerging-threads/#recommendations","title":"Recommendations:","text":"<p>Organizations should strengthen and keep their defense strategies against AI-driven attacks up to date.
